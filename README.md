# FFBEBot

The source code for a discord bot created to retrieve information about the game from the game wiki and the reddit wiki


To invite this bot use : https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=244615809559822338&scope=bot&permissions=null&response_type=code

The bot only needs basic message read/write permissions to be functional
Optionally you can allow the bot to delete messages to cleanup certain commands the may cause clutter
