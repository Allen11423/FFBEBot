# FFBEBot

The development of this project is currently suspended due to various reasons in part being busy.

The source code for a discord bot created to retrieve information about the game from the game wiki and the reddit wiki

See changelog.txt for the previous changes to the bot

To invite this bot use : https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=244615809559822338&scope=bot&permissions=null&response_type=code

The bot only needs basic message read/write permissions to be functional
Optionally you can allow the bot to delete messages to cleanup certain commands the may or may not cause clutter
